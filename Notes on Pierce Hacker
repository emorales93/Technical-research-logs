How useful is the site currently?(Be as specific as you can.)
I think the website is pretty useful since it has tutorials to help students use or better understand websites or different programs used to complete school project and homework.
How might it be more useful? (Again, specificity will help.)
Maybe adding videos with sound can help anyone who better understands tutorials that way. The tutorials page can be more eye catching and have more design.   
Thinking hopefully -- what would this project site do/be if we really made it both awesome and useful? (Again...specifically...)
The project site could be mentioned by Pierce College as the go to website recommended for anyone who needs help navigating through Pierce College's website. The project site can be very helpful towards any students having trouble using programs such as Microsoft Word, Excel, and Powerpoint. The Project site can recommend different programs with video tutorials on how to use them such as Github, Zotero and so on.
